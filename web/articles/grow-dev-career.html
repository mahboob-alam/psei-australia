    <h1>5 Ways to Grow Your Dev Career (Ethically)</h1>
    <div class="meta">Published: October 25, 2025 · By Mahboob Alam · PSEI Australia</div>
    <p>Growing your software development career doesn't require compromising your ethics or inflating your achievements. Here are five evidence-based strategies that deliver long-term career growth:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Build a Portfolio of Real Projects</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate your skills through tangible projects that solve real problems. Open-source contributions, personal applications, or freelance work showcase your abilities far better than claims or credentials alone.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Engage in Continuous Learning</h2>
    <p>Technology evolves rapidly. Dedicate time to learning new frameworks, languages, and best practices. Certifications from reputable institutions add credibility when paired with practical experience.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Network Authentically</h2>
    <p>Build genuine relationships within the developer community through meetups, conferences, and online forums. Authentic connections open doors to opportunities and mentorship.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Share Your Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Write technical blog posts, create tutorials, or speak at local meetups. Teaching others reinforces your understanding and establishes you as a thought leader in your field.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Focus on Soft Skills</h2>
    <p>Technical excellence is essential, but communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills distinguish great developers from good ones. Invest in developing these competencies alongside your technical abilities.</p>
