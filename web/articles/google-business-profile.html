    <p>Your Google Business Profile is often the first impression prospective students have of your training organization. Optimize it properly to increase visibility and enrollments:</p>
    
    <h2>Complete All Information Fields</h2>
    <p>Fill out your business name, address, phone, website, hours, and category. Google prioritizes complete profiles in local search results and Maps.</p>
    
    <h2>Choose the Right Categories</h2>
    <p>Select primary and secondary categories that accurately describe your offerings: "Educational Consultant," "Training Centre," "Computer Training School," etc. This affects which searches display your profile.</p>
    
    <h2>Add High-Quality Photos</h2>
    <p>Upload photos of your facilities, classrooms, equipment, and graduates (with permission). Profiles with photos receive more clicks and appear more trustworthy to potential students.</p>
    
    <h2>Collect and Respond to Reviews</h2>
    <p>Encourage satisfied students to leave honest reviews. Respond professionally to all reviews, both positive and negative. Active engagement signals credibility to Google and prospective students.</p>
    
    <h2>Post Regular Updates</h2>
    <p>Use the Posts feature to share course announcements, success stories, and helpful tips. Regular activity keeps your profile fresh and engaging in search results.</p>
